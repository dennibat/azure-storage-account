<p>
Start by creating a resource group in Azure. Use the search bar at the top of the web page to look for 'Resource Groups,' then select it from the results. Click 'Create' in the upper-left corner to begin. Give your resource group a name and, once you're ready, click 'Review and Create' at the bottom of the page to finalize it.

<p>
Next, search for 'Storage Accounts' in the same search bar. From the results, select 'Create' to set up a new storage account. Assign it to the resource group you created earlier. Give your storage account a unique name, then click 'Review' followed by 'Create' to complete the process.

<p>
To add a container to your storage account, first locate the resource group created earlier. You can find it either on the Azure homepage or by searching 'Resource Groups.' Once inside the resource group, click on the storage account you set up in the previous step. On the left-hand menu under 'Data Storage,' select 'Containers,' then click 'New Container.' Give your container a name and click 'Create' to add it.

After your container is created, click on it to open it. Select 'Upload' to add a file to your container. Simply choose the file you’d like to upload, and it’ll be stored securely in your container.

To edit a file, locate it within the container and click on the 'Context Menu' (the three dots to the right of the file name).
